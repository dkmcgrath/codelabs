<google-codelab-step label="Introduction" duration="1">
<p><img style="width:624px" src="img/3580c40a5d7546fc.png">The purpose of this series of codelabs is to build a simple blockchain application on the Hyperledger Sawtooth framework. You&#39;ll be creating a task manager that can help keep a person organized by dividing up their projects. Each project can have a multitude of tasks, keeping track of what is to be done per project. Tasks can be in various stages, from &#34;not started&#34; to &#34;completed&#34;. </p>
<p>In this codelab, we will go over the data structures used to send transactions over the network we will create, and we will also implement the logic to send these transactions from the client side. You will then test your code on a fully functional blockchain network that we already have set up.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>What you&#39;ll need</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Access and credit to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</li>
<li>Basic knowledge of Python</li>
</ul>
</google-codelab-step>
<google-codelab-step label="Setup firewall rules" duration="5">
<p>In this lab, we will provide you with a fully functioning backend server that processes transactions onto a Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain. As Compute Engine restricts traffic going into instances by default, before bringing this server up, we must first set up a firewall rule to allow traffic to reach the server. We first need to set up a firewall rule to allow clients to send transactions to this instance on the Hyperledger Sawtooth port (8008). As part of defining this firewall rule, we will associate it with a network tag so that any instance wishing to open up this port externally can use the tag to specify it. To do so, navigate to the &#34;VPC network&#34; part of the Google Cloud Platform console and click on &#34;Firewall rules&#34;</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:430px" src="img/497407304a185d43.png"></p>
<p>Then, create a firewall rule named &#34;<code>allow-transactions</code>&#34; with the settings shown below that will allow incoming traffic from any source to reach TCP port 8008.</p>

</google-codelab-step>
<google-codelab-step label="Setup backend VM" duration="5">
<p>We will now create the backend instance from a pre-built Compute Engine image. To do so, go to Compute Engine from the console and create an instance.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:479px" src="img/3859b2b08e70d4f4.png"></p>
<p>Configure the instance as below.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:516px" src="img/e7e8abd4dec8cb00.png"></p>
<p>When specifying the boot disk, click on &#34;Change&#34;</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:256px" src="img/4a33a531093396b3.png"></p>
<p>Click on the &#34;Custom images&#34; tab, then click on &#34;Select a Project&#34;.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:594px" src="img/813e318c2835c095.png"></p>
<p>In the &#34;Select from&#34; dropdown, click on &#34;No Organization&#34;, then on &#34;cs410b&#34;</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:461px" src="img/d863044de006b04e.png"></p>
<p><br>Finally, in the Image dropdown menu, select &#34;bc-backend-8008&#34;, then click on &#34;Select&#34;</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:582px" src="img/5d7f1359b0180e37.png"></p>
<p>Back in the VM configuration window, click on &#34;Allow HTTP traffic&#34; .</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:504px" src="img/351232e4ec6c5714.png"></p>
<p>Click on &#34;Management, security, disks, networking, ...&#34;, then within the interface, click on the &#34;Networking&#34; tab and then specify a network tag that you created in the previous step to allow port 8008 traffic (transaction-receive)</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:529px" src="img/ae25c1099538e3cd.png"></p>
<p>Finally, &#34;Create&#34; the VM.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:568px" src="img/ab7f4b118396091.png"></p>
<p>It will take some time for the instance to start running. Once the green check mark is next, the server has been successfully started. Note that it may take a short time before it is able to handle requests.</p>

</google-codelab-step>
<google-codelab-step label="Setup frontend VM" duration="5">
<p>We will now create another VM that will be used to run our frontend code. From this VM, we will issue transactions to the backend VM on port 8008.</p>
<p>Go back to Compute Engine and create a new instance named &#34;taskledger-frontend&#34; <img style="width:523px" src="img/8ecca5d391e47873.png"></p>
<p>Set the boot disk to be Ubuntu 18.04 LTS from the &#34;Public Images&#34; tab.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:571px" src="img/c13458b7d05dfab1.png"></p>
<p>Click on &#34;Allow HTTP Traffic&#34; as before.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:521px" src="img/12b546d956eb911e.png"></p>
<p>Once the green check mark is next to the name, click on <code>ssh</code> to get a shell on the instance.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:624px" src="img/7bd5dde1598aa174.png"></p>
<p>Make a note of the IP addresses of both the backend and frontend VMs. Internal IP addresses are private to your project and can not be accessed externally. External IP addresses can be accessed from the Internet.</p>
</google-codelab-step>
<google-codelab-step label="-" duration="5">
<p>After <code>ssh</code>-ing to the frontend instance, run the following commands to install some development tools.</p>
<pre>sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y python3-pip pkg-config libtool automake</pre>
<p>Then, install the Hyperledger Sawtooth SDK for Python:</p>
<pre>sudo pip3 install requests sawtooth-sdk==1.0.5</pre>
<p>Use the instructions from the course setup codelab to create an <code>ssh</code> key for your account and then add the public key to your account that stores your git repository. This will allow you to commit your work easily.</p>
<p>Then, clone the course repository that contains an initial skeleton of the code that you will fill in throughout this tutorial.</p>
<pre>git clone https://github.com/wu4f/cs410b-src.git</pre>
<p>Next, clone your repository from the previous step, copy the frontend files from the course repository into a directory in your repository named <code>sawtooth01</code>. Then, add, commit and push the new files into it.</p>
<pre>git clone git@&lt;git_provider&gt;:&lt;username&gt;/&lt;your-course-repo&gt;.git
mkdir &lt;your-course-repo&gt;/sawtooth01

<google-codelab-step label="Transactions" duration="1">
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>What are transactions?</strong></h2>
<p>Using a blockchain system requires all of the nodes in the network to be in agreement.</p>
<p>To change state, any user of the network must send messages called transactions. This causes each node that receives the transaction to register that the transfer has taken place. When this transaction reaches a transaction processor, the desired changes to state are made if the transaction is valid. In this lab, we will only be implementing the client side of creating transactions, which we will send to already functional transaction processors to test. In a future lab you will implement the logic the transaction processors use to change state based on transactions.</p>
<aside class="special"><p>Looking for more? Info on transactions can be found in <a href="https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/architecture/transactions_and_batches.html" target="_blank">Hyperledger&#39;s docs</a>.</p>

</google-codelab-step>
<google-codelab-step label="Protobuf Payloads" duration="2">
<p>Each transaction contains a payload of data which can be used by transaction processors to change state. A transaction to create a task would need a payload that contains a project name to list the task under, the name of the task, and a description for the task. To send this information over the network, we first need to encode it into a serialized binary format. Protobuf or Protocol Buffers are files that we create to generate python data types that can easily be encoded. The protobuf file that we will use for transaction payloads is shown below.</p>
<p>The message type called &#34;Payload&#34; is just a wrapper that will contain one of the other message types in the file. If a user is sending a transaction to create a task, they would include a &#34;CreateTaskAction&#34; message in their transaction. The message contains a project name, a task name, and a description. There is a message type in this file for every transaction action that we will be implementing, including creating a project, creating a task, progressing a task, editing a task, and adding contributors to a project.</p>

<google-codelab-step label="Signatures" duration="3">
<p>The other main component of a transaction is a digital signature that confirms the identity of the creator of the transaction. Each transaction is signed by a private-public keypair. The private key is used to generate a digital signature, which is sent as part of the transaction, and the public key can be used to verify that the creator of the transaction actually has the private key. </p>
<p>At the bottom of &#34;<code>transaction_factory.py</code>&#34; we use the list &#34;<code>sys.argv</code>&#34; to get the parameters given to the script by the user. The zeroth argument is the name of the function to call, which is called by &#34;<code>getattr</code>.&#34; For instance if the user wished to create a task, the 0th argument would be &#34;<code>create_task</code>,&#34; causing the code to call the function &#34;<code>txn_factory.create_task</code>&#34;, which we will implement later. </p>
<p>The first argument is a password, which can be converted to a 256 bit private key using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. We then create a signer object using the library secp256k1, which is a library containing functions to use bitcoin&#39;s implementation of ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). We don&#39;t need to go into depth to understand how this works, but it is one way to achieve public-private key encryption. This signer object that we create can later be used to sign the transaction we create.</p>

<google-codelab-step label="Creating a Payload: CreateProjectAction" duration="4">
<p>In this step we will go write some code to create the payload for a transaction that will create a project to list tasks under. First, we can look at the proto file that describes the payload data structure for this type of transaction, and we can see that the only information we need to include in the payload is the project name:</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>protos/payload.proto</h3>
<pre><code>message CreateProjectAction {
 //project name
 string project_name = 1;
}</code></pre>
<p>Now we are ready to bundle together the payload in python. Our function requires two arguments: a signer, which is necessary for signing transactions, and a name for the project. Other than just checking to make sure the correct number of arguments are present, all the function needs to do is initialize a CreateProjectAction protobuf message and then wrap it in Payload protobuf message. This Payload can be encoded into binary using the &#34;<code>SerializeToString()</code>&#34; function. Next we will put this payload data into a transaction and send it to the network.</p>

<p class="image-container"><img style="width:624px" src="img/8fa9e3c29b2dba3b.png"></p>
<p>The public key shown is the one created using the password you used to create the project. This password will be necessary to issue further transactions affecting this specific project.</p>

<google-codelab-step label="Creating a Payload: CreateTaskAction" duration="3">
<p>Now that we have the project creation done, we can move on to creating tasks. We can use the same code for creating transactions and batches, but the payload contained inside the transaction will be different.</p>
<p>Creating payloads for task creation transactions is quite similar to creating payloads for creating projects, but the function must be edited slightly for the additional fields in the CreateTaskAction protobuf message that constitutes our payload:</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>protos/payload.proto</h3>
<pre><code>message CreateTaskAction {
 string project_name = 1;
 string task_name = 2;
 string description = 3;
}</code></pre>
<p>With this in mind, we can edit the payload creation function we implemented in the previous step:</p>

<p>This time, the payload requires a public key, which is a 256 bits, so we probably don&#39;t want to have to type it all in.

<google-codelab-step label="Try it yourself: ProgressTaskAction" duration="20">
<p>Using what you have seen in the first 4 payload creation functions, implement a function that can create a payload for transactions that increase the progress of tasks. The proto message is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>message ProgressTaskAction {
 string project_name = 1;

<google-codelab-step label="Viewing and Decoding Past Transactions" duration="5">
<p>So far we&#39;ve used the <code>print_project.py</code> file to view the current state of a project, but in sawtooth, all transactions are saved forever, even if they are overwritten (for example, if a task description is edited twice, the record of first edit is still saved. In this step, we will look at and decode some of these stored transactions.</p>
<p>First, browse the url <code><externaladdressofbackendvm>:8008/transactions</externaladdressofbackendvm></code> using either a browser or curl. This page lists every transaction that has been validated and applied. Payloads can be found for each transaction:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:624px" src="img/74340c049b8dd515.png"></p>
<p>We can take these encoded strings and decode them. The following code takes an encoded payload, base64 decodes it, decodes it using protobuf, pulls payload out of the wrapper, and prints it.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>decode_payload.py</h3>
<pre><code>import base64
from protobuf.payload_pb2 import *

encoded_payload = &#39;(insert encoded payload here)&#39;

payload_wrapper = Payload()
# decode the payload from the binary format
payload_wrapper.ParseFromString(base64.b64decode(encoded_payload))
# define the desired action type indicated by the payload
action = payload_wrapper.action
timestamp = payload_wrapper.timestamp
# used to determine which handler function should be used on a certain type of payload
TYPE_TO_ACTION_HANDLER = {
    Payload.CREATE_PROJECT: &#39;create_project&#39;,

    print(attribute)
except KeyError:
    raise Exception(&#39;Specified action is invalid&#39;)
# extract the correct payload based on the action type
payload = getattr(payload_wrapper, attribute)
print(payload)</code></pre>
<p>This code can be run with the following command:</p>
