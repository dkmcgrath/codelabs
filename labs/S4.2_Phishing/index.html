<p>Once a target has been selected and information about them collected, phishing can be performed to obtain credentials. Phishing attacks often follow a familiar strategy to trick victims. In this step, we will examine methods that are commonly used by adversaries in an attack such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engendering trust from the victim of the source</li>
<li>Triggering a sense of urgency or fear in the victim to compel action</li>
<li>Collecting specific information or attempting to trick a victim into performing an activity</li>
</ul>
<p>Sites with helpful examples include the r/Scams subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/</a>, Cofense&#39;s database of phishing examples <a href="https://cofense.com/real-phishing-examples-and-threats/" target="_blank">https://cofense.com/real-phishing-examples-and-threats/</a>, Phishing.org&#39;s examples <a href="https://www.phishing.org/phishing-examples" target="_blank">https://www.phishing.org/phishing-examples</a> , and Berkeley&#39;s Phish Tank <a href="https://security.berkeley.edu/resources/phish-tank" target="_blank">https://security.berkeley.edu/resources/phish-tank</a> . Your own Junk mail folder for your pdx.edu account is also likely filled with examples. Find 3 phishing attacks that you feel are the most well-designed for users to click on. Then, analyze each one looking for the 3 methods above.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Include a screenshot of each attack and a description of how the attack embodies each of the 3 methods.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of phishing &#34;tells&#34; that you would teach people to look for to identify the attack. Attributes such as an incorrect sender domain, embedded links that don&#39;t match the sender&#39;s purported identity, the use of a URL shortener, poor formatting, poor spelling, and poor grammar are all examples of this.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For each example found above, how would you instruct someone in identifying it as a phishing attack? What specific &#34;tells&#34; are there?</strong></li>
</ul>
