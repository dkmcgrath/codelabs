<p>One of the more common service combinations for performing data science is to pair the backend data warehouse (BigQuery) with an interactive Python or R based Jupyter notebook. On GCP, a managed Jupyter notebook service is provided with the Vertex AI service. In this lab, we&#39;ll use the tools to perform a simple analysis of the birthweight of babies in a particular year.</p>
<p>First, begin by enabling the Vertex AI platform and its recommended APIs</p>
<pre><code>gcloud services enable notebooks.googleapis.com \
                       aiplatform.googleapis.com \
                       dataflow.googleapis.com \
                       storage.googleapis.com</code></pre>
<p>Vertex AI Notebooks wraps the configuration and startup of a Compute Engine instance that hosts an interactive Jupyter notebook that can be used to ingest data from BigQuery, process it, and generate data products from it. To begin with, we&#39;ll first want to create a service account that the instance will use to access BigQuery. Create a service account called <code>cs430jupyter</code> and then add an IAM policy that associates the role of BigQuery user to it.</p>
<pre>gcloud iam service-accounts create cs430jupyter
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT \
  --member serviceAccount:cs430jupyter@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role roles/bigquery.user</pre>
<p>Run the <code>gcloud</code> command below to bring up an instance, attaching the service account to it.</p>
<pre><code>gcloud notebooks instances create bq-jupyter-instance \
  --vm-image-project=deeplearning-platform-release \
  --vm-image-family=tf2-2-2-cpu \
  --machine-type=e2-medium \
  --location=us-west1-b \
  --service-account=cs430jupyter@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com</code></pre>
</google-codelab-step>
<google-codelab-step label="Launch notebook" duration="5">
<p>Search for Vertex AI, and then visit it from the console.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:624px" src="img/2a8485a8c4c95024.png"></p>
<p>Find the instance in the Workbench and click on &#34;Open Jupyterlab&#34; when the instance comes up.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:624px" src="img/d30120b0608367fc.png"></p>
<p>Create a Python 3 notebook and leave it open.</p>

</google-codelab-step>
<google-codelab-step label="BigQuery query" duration="3">
<p>Visit the BigQuery console to compose a new query that will dump the entire table that we&#39;ll be querying, but DO NOT run the query. </p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM bigquery-public-data.samples.natality</code></pre>
<p>Instead, see the amount of data that the query will go through. This is the size of the table.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:624px" src="img/f6124db50925c308.png"></p>
<p>We&#39;ll be running a query to obtain data on birthweight from a publicly available natality dataset hosted on the platform. </p>
<p>Modify the &lt;<code>FMI</code>&gt; in the <code>WHERE</code> statement of the query template below with a SQL conjunction that returns the number of babies born and their average weight between 2001 and 2003 and their plurality (e.g. single, twins, triplets, etc.) in ascending order.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
  plurality,
  COUNT(1) AS num_babies,
  AVG(weight_pounds) AS avg_wt
FROM
  bigquery-public-data.samples.natality
WHERE
  year &lt;FMI&gt;
GROUP BY
  plurality
ORDER BY
  plurality ASC</code></pre>
<p>Before running the query, answer the following question for your lab notebook:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How much less data does this query process compared to the size of the table?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Run the query and answer the following for your lab notebook:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How many twins were born during this time range?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How much lighter on average are they compared to single babies?</strong></li>
</ul>
</google-codelab-step>
<google-codelab-step label="Jupyter notebook query" duration="2">
<p>Go back to your notebook. We will now repeat the query in Python. Enter the query from the previous step to construct the query string in one of the cells.</p>
<pre><code>query_string = &#34;&#34;&#34;
SELECT
  plurality,
  COUNT(1) AS num_babies,
  etc...
&#34;&#34;&#34;</code></pre>
<p>Then click on the play button to execute the command to set the query string variable.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:624px" src="img/808645bd017a1336.png"></p>
<p>Then, in a single cell, enter in code that imports the BigQuery Python package, creates a BigQuery client, issues the query, obtains the response as a Pandas data frame, and outputs the first three results (e.g. single, twins, and triplets). Click on the play button to execute the code.</p>
<pre><code>from google.cloud import bigquery
df = bigquery.Client().query(query_string).to_dataframe()
df.head(3)</code></pre>
<p>The results should match your prior results in BigQuery. Using the plotting facility of Pandas, create a scatter plot that visualizes the average weight of a baby given its plurality by placing the following code in a cell and executing it.</p>
<pre><code>df.plot(x=&#39;plurality&#39;, y=&#39;avg_wt&#39;, kind=&#39;scatter&#39;)</code></pre>
</google-codelab-step>
<google-codelab-step label="Exploring the dataset" duration="2">
<p>The plot in the previous step shows a marked correlation between birthweight and plurality. If we were attempting to predict the birth weight of a baby that is about to be born using a machine learning model, the plurality would be a good feature to include.</p>
<p>In the next steps, we&#39;ll be exploring other features that might be predictive of birth weight. Go back to your notebook and run the following code in a cell.</p>
<pre><code>query_string = &#34;&#34;&#34;
SELECT
  weight_pounds,
  is_male,
  mother_age,
  plurality,
  gestation_weeks
FROM
  publicdata.samples.natality
WHERE year &gt; 2000
&#34;&#34;&#34;

from google.cloud import bigquery
df = bigquery.Client().query(query_string + &#34; LIMIT 100&#34;).to_dataframe()
df.head()</code></pre>
<p>The query produces all of the babies born after 2000, their weight, their gender, their mother&#39;s age, their plurality, and their gestation time. We have seen that plurality is highly correlated with birth weight, but what about the other attributes? To determine the answer to this question, we&#39;ll use the following function <code>get_distinct_values(column_name)</code> that parametrizes the initial query, but substitutes an attribute that is passed as <code>column_name</code> instead of using <code>plurality</code>. Examine the code, then paste it into a cell in your notebook and hit play.</p>
<pre><code>def get_distinct_values(column_name):
  query_string = f&#34;&#34;&#34;
SELECT
  {column_name},
  COUNT(1) AS num_babies,
  AVG(weight_pounds) AS avg_wt
FROM
  publicdata.samples.natality
WHERE
  year &gt; 2000
GROUP BY
  {column_name}
  &#34;&#34;&#34;
  return bigquery.Client().query(query_string).to_dataframe().sort_values(column_name)</code></pre>
</google-codelab-step>
<google-codelab-step label="Run queries" duration="5">
<p>We&#39;ll now run our queries and view their plots. First, re-run the <code>plurality</code> query using the function, but generate a bar graph instead.</p>
<pre><code>df = get_distinct_values(&#39;plurality&#39;)
df.plot(x=&#39;plurality&#39;, y=&#39;avg_wt&#39;, kind=&#39;bar&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Then, run the query using gender:</p>
<pre><code>df = get_distinct_values(&#39;is_male&#39;)
df.plot(x=&#39;is_male&#39;, y=&#39;avg_wt&#39;, kind=&#39;bar&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Then, run the query using gestation time:</p>
<pre><code>df = get_distinct_values(&#39;gestation_weeks&#39;)
df.plot(x=&#39;gestation_weeks&#39;, y=&#39;avg_wt&#39;, kind=&#39;bar&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, run the query using the mother&#39;s age:</p>
<pre><code>df = get_distinct_values(&#39;mother_age&#39;)
df.plot(x=&#39;mother_age&#39;, y=&#39;avg_wt&#39;, kind=&#39;bar&#39;)</code></pre>

<p>Google hosts a number of COVID-19 datasets that we can query and generate information from. One dataset is its mobility one that measures the impact lockdown orders had in various locales. To begin with, go to the BigQuery console Explorer, click on &#34;ADD DATA&#34;, then select the BigQuery Public Dataset (<code>bigquery-public-data</code>) project. </p>
