<p>For this lab, we will be deploying a simple contract called MyContract that takes in ETH (the cryptocurrency used for Ethereum transactions). Anyone can send ETH to this contract and anyone can destroy it. Upon destruction, all ETH from the contract is sent to its owner (the wallet that has deployed the contract).</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Walk-through the source code</h2>
<pre><code>pragma solidity 0.4.24;
contract MyContract {
        address public owner;

        constructor () public payable {
                owner = msg.sender;
        }

        function getBalance() external view returns(uint) {
                return address(this).balance;
        }

        function cashOut() external {
                selfdestruct(owner);
        }

        function () public payable {
        }
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Solidity compiler version specified as 0.4.24. Can use the syntax ^0.4.24 to denote any compiler higher than 0.4.24</li>
<li><code>contract</code> keyword names the contract as MyContract</li>
<li>A single declared storage variable named <code>owner</code> is defined to be of type <code>address</code> (a 20-byte Ethereum wallet or contract address)</li>
<li>A constructor function sets the <code>owner</code> variable of the smart contract to <code>msg.sender</code> (the address of the wallet that deploys the contract). This will eventually be used to ensure the ETH from the contract is returned to the contract creator</li>
<li><code>getBalance()</code> function is declared with keywords <code>external</code> (function may be called from outside addresses) and <code>view</code> (function does not modify state). Keyword returns specifies that it will return a <code>uint</code> (unsigned integer) to represent the balance of the contract.</li>
<li><code>cashOut()</code> function is declared with keyword <code>external</code>. It invokes a Solidity built-in function called <code>selfdestruct()</code> with parameter <code>owner</code>. This destroys the contract, removing its state, but not its history from the blockchain. It then transfers any funds the contract has to the address specified by <code>owner</code> (the creator of the contract). Note that <code>address(this)</code> returns the current contract&#39;s address and the <code>balance</code> attribute which is built-in to Solidity to return the amount of ETH the contract currently has.</li>
<li>A required fallback function <code>()</code> that is both <code>public</code> (accessible by all) and <code>payable</code> (can receive ETH). The fallback function is called whenever a user sends a contract ETH directly via their wallet. It is also called when someone tries to call a function in the contract that does not exist. (This will turn into a security issue in one of the SI CTF levels)</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Use <code>selfdestruct()</code> at your own peril (if you like keeping your $)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring that your contract lives on forever for people to use means that any use of the <code>selfdestruct()</code> call is protected properly.</li>
<li>Remix contains a static analysis tool that will point out this dangerous call</li>

<p>Note that this code must be modified to include the contract address it is intended to call. From the previous step in the lab, copy the address of your version of MyContract that has been deployed and replace the value of <code><yourcontractaddressformycontract></yourcontractaddressformycontract></code> in the code with it. </p>
<p>Read the code to find the following in the contract code</p>
<ul>
<li>Solidity compiler version specified as 0.4.24</li>
<li>An <code>interface</code> to MyContract. This specifies the function name and parameters for any function call in MyContract that is called by KillMyContract. In this case, we only wish to call one function in MyContract i.e. <code>cashOut()</code>so it is the only function included in the declaration. </li>
<li>An address storage variable called <code>myContractAddr</code> that contains the address of your deployed MyContract set above.</li>
<li>An external function called <code>kill()</code> for you to call</li>
<li><code>kill()</code> declares a local memory variable <code>mc</code> that is declared as a MyContract interface type. It is bound to the address <code>myContractAddr.</code></li>
<li><code>kill()</code> then invokes the <code>cashOut()</code> call of mc by invoking it via <code>mc.cashOut()</code></li>
</ul>

<google-codelab-step label="KillMyContract compilation, deployment, and interaction in Remix" duration="2">
<p>Repeat the above steps from MyContract for KillMyContract</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile and deploy KillMyContract via Remix. Note: The connection between Remix and Metamask may timeout. If your &#34;Deploy&#34; does not work, reload Remix to perform this step. Ensure you are using the &#34;Injected Web3&#34; environment connected to Ropsten.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:534px" src="img/6171fbdff65a2bb2.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Then, instead of using MyCrypto to interact with a contract, interact with KillMyContract directly in Remix. Expand the contract and invoke the <code>kill()</code> function by clicking on it and confirming the transaction through Metamask.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width:535px" src="img/7e1c7df9159fb31a.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>This will invoke <code>kill()</code>, which will invoke <code>cashOut()</code> on MyContract, which will then cause MyContract to <code>selfdestruct()</code>, which will then send all of MyContract&#39;s ETH back to your wallet.</li>
</ul>

<li>Go back to Etherscan to locate your original MyContract contract.</li>
<li>Click on the &#34;Internal Txns&#34; tab. These are transactions that have come from within the blockchain (rather than from a wallet outside of the blockchain)</li>
<li>Take a screenshot that shows the two internal transactions that have occured to include in your lab notebook. The bottom one is the call from KillMyContract&#39;s address to MyContract that invokes <code>cashOut()</code> while the top one is the result of MyContract&#39;s invocation of <code>selfdestruct()</code>to send the contract&#39;s balance over to the owner wallet. </li>

<p>You have now funded a contract and received the funds back from it upon its self-destruction. However, these transactions are not free. To keep the network operating, miners and full-nodes must be paid for their operation. Transaction fees are an often-overlooked fact of life on any blockchain and the myriad of blockchains compete to provide similar functionality at a cheaper price while still ensuring security from tampering.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve completed the &#34;Hello World&#34; of smart contracts and their deployments on Ethereum. While simple contracts such as the ones shown here might make it seem like smart contracts with Solidity are a good idea, subsequent labs and assignments will show you otherwise. Much like we teach C at Portland State in order to show how easy it is to create security problems with it, we teach Solidity to do the same. If you can avoid using Solidity to implement smart contracts, we would recommend doing so.</p>
